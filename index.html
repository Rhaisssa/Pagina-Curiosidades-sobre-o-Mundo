                                        Queimada Grande Island, located 35 kilometers off the coast of SÃ£o Paulo, is one of the most dangerous and restricted places on the planet. It was discovered in 1532 by the colonizing expedition of Martim Afonso de Souza. It is estimated that there may be between one and five snakes per square meter of the island. Due to the high risk that this situation represents, the Brazilian government has prohibited people from entering the island. The exception is only for authorized researchers, who, in order to conduct studies on site, must follow strict safety protocols and always be accompanied by a doctor.
