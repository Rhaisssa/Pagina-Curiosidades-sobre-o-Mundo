                    <h1>Discover the 5 most beautiful and unknown places in the world</h1>
                    <h3>Snake Island</h3>

                    <div class="cartao-conteudo-sobre">
                        Queimada Grande Island, located 35 kilometers off the coast of São Paulo, is one of the most
                        dangerous and restricted places on the planet. It was discovered in 1532 by the colonizing
                        expedition of Martim Afonso de Souza. It is estimated that there may be between one and five
                        snakes
                        per square meter of the island. Due to the high risk that this situation represents, the
                        Brazilian
                        government has prohibited people from entering the island. The exception is only for authorized
                        researchers, who, in order to conduct studies on site, must follow strict safety protocols and
                        always be accompanied by a doctor.

                    <h3>The French cave of Lascaux</h3>
                    <div class="cartao-conteudo-Sobre">
                        <p>Com cerca de 17 mil anos, esta caverna fica localizada no sul da França é um dos exemplos
                            mais bem preservados de arte pré-histórica no planeta. São cerca de 600 pinturas e mil
                            gravuras estampadas nas paredes rochosas do local.

                            Oito anos depois de sua descoberta, em 1940, a caverna de Lascaux foi aberta ao público. Em
                            1963 as visitas foram suspensas, pois a entrada de turistas afetou a caverna, provocando o
                            crescimento de fungos e micróbios.

                            Quase 60 anos depois, visitas à caverna continuam altamente restritas para evitar a
                            destruição permanente da arte rupestre. Por isso, réplicas foram construídas nas
                            proximidades para que os turistas possam conhecer as pinturas históricas."</p>

                        <p>Area 51 is a region that houses one of the most important US Air Force bases. It is located
                            in the Nevada desert, 135 kilometers north of Las Vegas. Everything that goes on inside is
                            extremely secret, and this secrecy has helped fuel many conspiracy theories, especially
                            those related to extraterrestrials. Access is strictly prohibited, despite dozens of people
                            trying to get there every year.</p>

                    <div class=" cartao-conteudo-Sobre">
                        <p>The mystery surrounding the tribe living on North Sentinel Island is so great that no one
                            even knows what language its inhabitants speak, or how many there are. What is known is that
                            this is one of the last groups in the world that has no contact with outside civilization.
                            The island, part of the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago in the Bay of Bengal in the Indian
                            Ocean, is more than a thousand kilometers from any port, the closest one on the Indian
                            mainland. Visits by outsiders are prohibited, mainly due to the risk of contaminating the
                            natives with diseases from outside. In addition, the Sentinelese, as the island's
                            inhabitants are called, are known for protecting their territory and attacking intruders.
